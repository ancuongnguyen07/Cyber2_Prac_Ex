\section{Task 1 --- Becoming a Certificate Authority (CA)}
%

\textbf{What part of the certificate indicates this is a CA's certificate?}\\
%
When a CA issues a certificate, it includes the "Basic Constraints"
extension in the certificate and sets the "CA" field to "true". This
indicates that the certificate is a CA certificate and can be used to
issue other certificates.

\begin{verbatim}
    ...
    X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical
    CA:TRUE # this part indicates that it is a CA's cert
    ...
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{What part of the certificate indicates this a self-signed
certificate?}\\
%
The field of {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont Issuer} and {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont
Subject} matches each other, indicating this is a self-signed certificate.
In this case, \emph{www.modelCA.com} is both issuer and subject.

\textbf{Identify the values of elements in the RSA algorithm}\\
